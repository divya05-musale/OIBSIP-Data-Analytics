Retail Sales Data Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Internship Information
This project is completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Internship.

Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to understand sales patterns, customer segments, and shipping behavior. The analysis helps in identifying meaningful insights to support business decision-making.

Problem Statement
Retail businesses generate large amounts of sales data, but without proper analysis, valuable insights remain hidden. The goal of this project is to analyze historical retail sales data and answer key business questions related to sales distribution, customer segments, and shipping timelines.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
Order and shipping dates
Customer segment
Product category and sub-category
Sales values
Location details (city, state, region)
Data was checked for missing values and consistency before analysis.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

Steps Performed
Imported and explored the dataset
Checked and handled missing values
Converted date columns into datetime format
Created a new feature Shipping_Days
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis
Visualized sales distribution and segment-wise sales
Analyzed shipping time distribution
Interpreted results to derive business insights

Key Insights
Sales data shows a right-skewed distribution, indicating a small number of high-value orders
Consumer segment contributes most to total sales
Most orders are shipped within a limited number of days, indicating efficient logistics
Sales performance varies across product categories and regions

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how EDA can uncover important trends and patterns in retail sales data. Insights can help improve sales strategies, customer targeting, and operational efficiency.

This project is created solely for educational and internship purposes.
