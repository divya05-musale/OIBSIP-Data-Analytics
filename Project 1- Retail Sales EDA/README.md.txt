📌 Internship Information

Internship Program: Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Internship
Intern Name: Divya Musale
Domain: Data Analytics
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Project Overview

This project is part of the Oasis Infobyte Data Analytics Internship.
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and shipping timelines using Python.

❓ Problem Statement

Retail organizations generate large volumes of sales data. Without proper analysis, valuable insights related to customer behavior, sales distribution, and logistics efficiency remain hidden. This project aims to analyze retail sales data and extract meaningful business insights.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains retail transaction information including:

Order and shipping dates

Customer segments

Product categories and sub-categories

Sales values

City, state, and region details

The dataset was checked for missing values, data consistency, and correct data types before analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

🔍 Steps Performed

Imported the dataset and explored its structure

Checked rows, columns, data types, and missing values

Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Converted date columns into datetime format

Created new features for analysis

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized sales distribution and trends

Interpreted business insights

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualizations

Sales distribution analysis

Segment-wise sales comparison

Category-wise and region-wise sales analysis

Shipping days analysis

(All visualizations are included in the notebook.)

💡 Key Insights

Sales data shows a right-skewed distribution

Certain customer segments contribute higher sales

Product category and region significantly impact sales

Shipping timelines are fairly consistent

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how EDA can uncover hidden patterns in retail sales data. The insights obtained can help businesses improve sales strategies, customer targeting, and logistics planning.
