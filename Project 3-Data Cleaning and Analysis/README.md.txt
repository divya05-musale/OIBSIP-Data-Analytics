Student Performance Analysis

Internship Information
This project is completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte – Data Analytics Internship.

Project Overview
The goal is to analyze student academic performance data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between attendance, study hours, department, and exam results.

Problem Statement
Educational institutions collect data on student attendance, study habits, and exam marks. Without proper analysis, it is difficult to identify key factors affecting performance. This project performs EDA to uncover insights.

Dataset Description

Column	Description
Student_ID	-Unique ID of student
Gender	-Male / Female
Age	-Student age
Department	-Academic department (e.g., Computer, Civil)
Attendance_%	-Attendance percentage
Study_Hours_Per_Day	-Average study hours per day
Internal_Marks	-Marks obtained in internal assessments
Final_Exam_Marks-	Marks obtained in final exam
Grade-	Final grade based on marks

Data was checked for missing values and consistency.

Tools and Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Steps Performed
Imported and explored dataset
Checked rows, columns, data types, and missing values
Performed descriptive statistics using df.describe()
Visualized data using histograms, boxplots, bar charts, scatter plots
Analyzed relationships between attendance, study hours, department, gender, and final marks
Derived actionable insights

Key Insights
Distribution of final exam marks highlights performance trends
Gender-wise performance differences
Average marks vary across departments
Attendance positively correlates with final marks
Study hours per day affect results
Grade distribution identifies high- and low-performing students

Conclusion
EDA provides meaningful insights into student performance and helps in academic strategies, student support, and personalized learning interventions.

This project is created solely for educational and internship purposes.
